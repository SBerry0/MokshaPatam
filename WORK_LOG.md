After I did that, it makes it much easier to check if the square I'm on is in that array. Next I started to make the breadth first search by doing a pretty similar thing to what we did last year in MazeSolver, so I opened that up and started on it. I'm planning on making a DFS version as well and check which one is faster. |

I tried counting the number of steps for each addition, but that's just a terrible idea because the solution isn't going to only add 4 or something like that. |

I have to go now, but I'll check if my first fix works. I've also pivoted to DFS because I think that will be easier to find the number of steps it takes. |

Now, I'm sorting the stack after every time so that it uses the highest number of the stack first. The only problem now is that I can't confirm that what I'm doing is the fastest way to the end. I'm pretty sure this is an inherent part of DFS so I can't think of anything to fix it. I'm going to try BFS again with the things I've changed. |

If I make the queue a queue of an array of ints instead of just one number. The array would have the step in the first position and the number of steps it took to get to that square in the second position. I had to find new ways to check if there were duplicates in the queue, but other than that, it was pretty similar. Most of the tests work, now I just have to return -1 if there is no solution. |
| Sept 1 | 11:30-12:15am | I fixed the error of it going into an endless loop and have it returning -1 now, so it passes all of the tests. At first I was going to check if the last six squares of the board was snakes manually, but then I realized it would still be unsolvable if there was snakes everywhere except that last six and it wouldn't flag that as impossible. So then I decided to count the number of items in the possibilites that it plateued at like 70 and wasn't consistent. Finally I realized that I could store all of the squares I have been to without duplicates and count the length of that. I used a set because that would remove the duplicates automatically. I also had to subtract the number of snakes from the total to account for all visitable squares. |
